# Introduction

## What is Ramclouds API?

Ramclouds API is a unified AI gateway that provides access to multiple AI models through a single, OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. Whether you want to use GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, or any other supported model, you can do it all with one API key.

## Why Use Ramclouds?

### 1. Unified Interface
Instead of managing multiple API keys and learning different API formats for each provider, use one API key and one consistent format.

### 2. Cost Effective
Competitive pricing with pay-as-you-go billing. No subscription required.

### 3. Easy Migration
If you're already using OpenAI's API, switching to Ramclouds is as simple as changing the base URL.

### 4. Model Flexibility
Switch between models without changing your code. Want to try Claude instead of GPT? Just change the model name.
